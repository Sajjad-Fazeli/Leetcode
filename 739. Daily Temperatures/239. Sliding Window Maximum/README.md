# Sliding Window Maximum

Given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Your task is to return the maximum value within the sliding window for each position it moves.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output:

Explanation:
The window moves as follows, and the maximum for each window is calculated:

Window Position          Max Value
---------------         ---------
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums =, k = 1
Output:
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
